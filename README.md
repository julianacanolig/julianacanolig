ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Juliana  

Iâ€™m a front-end developer and brand designer with a background in business administration and a masterâ€™s in information systems. I enjoy creating digital experiences that balance design, functionality, and strategy.  

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in projects that combine technology and creativity â€” from building web apps that solve everyday problems to designing clean, engaging user interfaces.  

Iâ€™m currently working on a FAQ app for students that helps them quickly find campus resources, as well as a travel app about hidden gems that highlights must-see spots beyond the usual tourist places. Both projects are helping me sharpen my JavaScript and front-end skills.  

I love blending design with tech and often collaborate on projects that require both coding and branding.
